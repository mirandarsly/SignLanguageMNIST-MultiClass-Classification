# Sign Language MNIST MultiClass Classification
This project explores using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify American Sign Language letters from 28x28 grayscale images in the Sign Language MNIST dataset (source: https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist). This notebook will delve into data preprocessing, building and training the CNN model, exploring its architecture and performance. The goal is to gain insights into the effectiveness of CNNs for recognizing hand gestures and potentially contribute to accessible communication technologies.
